# iSP-Network-Design
This project simulates a small ISP network in Cisco Packet Tracer. Two customer LANs are connected to an ISP router using WAN links and static routing. PCs from both networks can communicate through the ISP. This project helps understand routing, IP addressing, and network connectivity.
